# Art Gallery Problem
This code was adopted by this git repo https://github.com/AyushBhandariNITK/Art_Gallery_problem

The code was further adapted to suit the need of robotics where a camera coverage problem needs to be solved.
The code was modified to take in as input a text file with the coordinates of a triangle: x1, y1  x2, y2 x3, y3 where x1,y1 is the coordinates of the first vector in the triangle.

The code then outputs the coordinates of the positions for the robots that it needs to ensure full camera coverage of the interior of a room.
